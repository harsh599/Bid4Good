Bid4Good is an online auction website, a digital platform that allows users to buy and sell items through a bidding process. Our website provides a wide variety of goods, ranging from antiques to electronics to vehicles, and allows sellers to list their items for auction

## [](#features)Features

**[](#live-auction)Live Auction**

Our online auction website offers live auction, allowing users to bid in real-time as the auction is taking place.

## [](#blind-auction)

**Blind Auction**

We also offer blind auction, which is a type of auction where bidders submit their bids without knowing what other bidders have offered. Blind auction can help prevent bidding wars and keep prices from skyrocketing, as bidders are less likely to get caught up in the excitement of the moment and bid more than they can afford.

## [](#simple-selling)

**Simple Selling**

For sellers who don't want to go through the auction process, we offer a simple selling feature. This allows them to list their items for sale at a fixed price, without waiting for an auction to end.

## [](#issue-reporting)

**Issue Reporting**

We take the integrity of our auctions seriously and have systems in place for reporting issues. If you encounter any suspicious activity or fraudulent sellers, please report them to our team. We also have a mechanism for resolving disputes between buyers and sellers to ensure a fair and transparent auction process.

## [](#wishlist)

**Wishlist**

The Wishlist feature allows users to create a list of items that they want to purchase in the future. Users can add items to their wishlist by clicking a button on the item's product page, and can view their list of items at any time from Home Page. This feature is useful for users who want to save items for later or keep track of products they're interested in.

## [](#admin)

**Admin**

The Admin feature allows website administrators to manage and control various aspects of the website, including user accounts, products, and reported issues. Administrators can view user information, products from the website, and view detailed order information. This feature is important for maintaining the functionality and security of the website.

## [](#order-details)

**Order Details**

The Order Details feature allows users to view information about their past orders, including the items they purchased, the date and time of the order, and the total cost. Users can access their order details from their account dashboard, and can also receive email notifications with order information. This feature is useful for users who want to track their purchases and keep a record of their transactions.

Overall, our online auction website provides a convenient and exciting way for buyers and sellers to connect and exchange goods. Whether you're looking for a rare collectible or trying to sell your unwanted items, our platform is the perfect place to start.
